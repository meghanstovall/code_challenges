# Bob is preparing to pass IQ test.
# The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given
# numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs
# from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a
# program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness,
# and return a position of this number.
#
# ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test,
# which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)
